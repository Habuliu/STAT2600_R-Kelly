# Does Smoking Lead to Babies Born Prematurely and with Low Birth Weight?

### Team RKelly (Gregor, Sasha, Lauren, Ping, Peter)

Two Main Questions:
1. Do mothers who smoke have a greater chance of having a premature delivery?
2. Do newborns of mothers who have smoked have smaller birth weights at each gestational age?

Other things to keep in mind (Potential topics to plot for individual part): 
* There could be various factors that influence gestation length and birth weight. These variables need to be identified, and see how they'll influence the relationship between smoking and premature delivery, as well as smoking and smaller gestational age weights
* Which variables are similar between smokers and non-smokers, which are different?
