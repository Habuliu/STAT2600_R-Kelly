**About me**


* I'm interested in what discoveries in our universe can be made with the abundance of data we recieve from our satelites. 
* I would love to be gaining experience in the field of Data Science, whether that's through an internship or a full-time job. 5 years after that I would love to use my data analysis skills to become an important decision maker in some start-up tech company
* I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be finding a profession in a field that interests me, while also feeling I'm doing meaningful work. With this course, my biggest goal is to learn the techniques behind properly communicating my ideas.
* I spent 3 weeks in Thailand with my family. It was the best and most diverse vacation I've ever had, as it gave me a perspective of the East Asian world that I hadn't had before.

* I would love to use data analyzing methods in investment research. I currently work as an investment researcher for a Wealth Management firm, and knowing how to effectively organize and analyze data would be so helpful with the process. 

* Six months after graduation I would love to be working in New York doing Equity Research and Financial Analysis. Five years for now I would love to be settled in an awesome job while also pursing my passion for videography. 

* I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be owning my own firm. This course can help me acheive my goal as it will teach  my important organization and collaboration skills.

* I am a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and just finished my term as President of our Chapter. It was truly the most amazing experience I could ever ask for, in which I learned many problem solving and team collaboration skills. 

Feedback from Gregor: I think your aspirations for the future are awesome, and it seems like you're on a great path to achieve them. You might want to add what you learned exactly in your sorority and how it changed you exactly, I'm curious to hear.
