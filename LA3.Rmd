I chose to examine the correlation between smoking, holding a health plan, and general health. The plot below  
shows how the relationship between smoking and holding a health plan changes based on general health, with the  
general trend indicating that individuals who do not hold a health plan are more likley to smoke than others. 
'''{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(as.factor(hlthplan), fill=as.factor(smoke100))) +
     geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
        
    facet_wrap(~ genhlth, nrow = 2)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
